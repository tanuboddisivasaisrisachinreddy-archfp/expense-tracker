I spend a lot of money on different things and needed a simple way to track my expenses.
This is a web-based expense tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to log, categorize, and visualize my spending. All data is stored in localStorage, so I can check my spending anytime without losing data.
Features

Add Expenses with:

Description

Amount

Category (Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Other)

View Expenses in a clean, sortable table.

Highlight overspending – amounts above a set threshold appear in red.

Visualize spending using a dynamic pie chart to see which categories consume most of my budget.

Persistent storage using localStorage – data remains even after refreshing the browser.

How I Use It

Open expense-tracker.html in a browser.

Enter the expense details (what I bought, how much, category).

Click Add Expense.

Check the table for all my recorded expenses.

See a quick visual overview in the pie chart to monitor overspending.
